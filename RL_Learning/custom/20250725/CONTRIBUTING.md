### Feature Requests

For feature requests, please provide:

- **Clear description** of the proposed feature
- **Use case**: Why would this be useful?
- **Proposed implementation** (if you have ideas)
- **Alternatives considered**

### Code Contributions

#### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** to see if someone is already working on it
2. **Create an issue** to discuss major changes before implementing
3. **Start small** for your first contribution

#### Development Workflow

1. **Create a branch** for your feature/fix
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-number
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the coding standards (see below)
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   # Run basic tests
   python main.py env-test
   python -m pytest tests/  # If tests exist
   
   # Test the main functionality
   python main.py train  # Quick training test
   python main.py test   # Testing with existing model
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Brief description of changes"
   ```

5. **Push and create pull request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

#### Coding Standards

- **Python Style**: Follow PEP 8
- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings
- **Type Hints**: Add type hints for function parameters and returns
- **Comments**: Explain complex logic, not obvious code
- **Variable Names**: Use descriptive names

**Example:**
```python
def calculate_reward(self, observation: np.ndarray) -> float:
    """
    Calculate reward based on frequency detuning.
    
    Args:
        observation: Current system observation containing detuning info
        
    Returns:
        Reward value (negative absolute detuning)
    """
    detuning = observation[3]  # Frequency detuning in kHz
    return -np.abs(detuning)
```

#### Documentation Standards

- **Header Comments**: All files should have comprehensive headers
- **Function Documentation**: Document all public functions
- **README Updates**: Update README for new features
- **Examples**: Provide usage examples for new features

#### Testing Guidelines

- **Test Coverage**: Aim for good test coverage of new code
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions/methods
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **Performance Tests**: For performance-critical changes
