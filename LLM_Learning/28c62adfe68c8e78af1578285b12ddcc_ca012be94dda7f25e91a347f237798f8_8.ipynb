(the “Company” or “Bilibili”) is an iconic brand and a leading video community for young generations in China. Incorporated as a\\nlimited liability company in the Cayman Islands in December 2013, the Company, through its consolidated subsidiaries, variable interest entities\\n(“VIEs”) and subsidiaries of the VIEs (collectively referred to as the “Group”), is primarily engaged in the operation of providing online entertainment\\nservices to users in the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC” or “China”).\\nIn April 2018, the Company completed its IPO on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. In March 2021, the Company successfully listed its\\nClass Z ordinary shares on the main board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The Company issued a total 28,750,000 Class Z ordinary shares in the\\nglobal offering, including the fully exercised over-allotment option of 3,750,000 Class Z ordinary shares. Net proceeds from the global offering,\\nincluding the over-allotment option, after deducting underwriting fees and other offering expenses, were approximately HKD22.9 billion (RMB19.3\\nbillion).\\nOn October 3, 2022 (the “Primary Conversion Effective Date”), the Company’s voluntary conversion of its secondary listing status to primary\\nlisting on the main board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange became effective. The Company became a dual-primary listed company on the main board\\nof Hong Kong Stock Exchange in Hong Kong and the NASDAQ Global Select Market in the United States.\\nIn January 2023, the Company completed the offering of 15,344,000 ADSs at US$26.65 per ADS. The amount of net proceeds from such offering\\n(after deducting all applicable costs and expenses including but not limited to selling commission) is approximately US$396.9 million (RMB2,689.4\\nmillion). Shortly thereafter, the Company completed repurchased of an aggregate principal amount of US$384.8 million (RMB2.6 billion) of its\\noutstanding 0.5% convertible senior notes due December 2026 with an aggregate purchase price of US$331.2 million (RMB2.2 billion), which was\\nfunded by the net proceeds from the ADS Offering.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s major subsidiaries, VIEs and subsidiaries of the VIEs are as follows:\\nPercentage of\\nDirect or Indire ct\\nPlace and Year of Economic\\nMajor Subsidiaries Incorporation Ownership Principal Activities\\nBilibili HK Limited Hong Kong, 2014 100 Investment holding\\nHode HK Limited Hong Kong, 2014 100 Investment holding\\nChaodian HK Limited Hong Kong, 2019 100 Investment holding\\nBilibili Co., Ltd.

Operations (Continued)\\nContractual agreements with major VIEs\\nIn order to comply with the PRC laws and regulations which prohibit or restrict foreign control of companies involved in provision of internet\\ncontent services, the Group operates its restricted businesses in the PRC through the VIEs, whose equity interests are held by certain founders of the\\nGroup. The Company obtained control over these VIEs by entering into a series of contractual arrangements with the legal shareholders who are also\\nreferred to as nominee shareholders. These nominee shareholders are the legal owners of the VIEs. However, the rights of those nominee shareholders\\nhave been transferred to the Company through the contractual arrangements.\\nThe contractual arrangements that are used to control the VIEs include powers of attorney, exclusive technology consulting and services\\nagreements or exclusive business cooperation agreements, equity pledge agreements and exclusive option agreements. Management concluded that the\\nCompany, through the contractual arrangements, has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs’ economic performance,\\nbears the risks of and enjoys the rewards normally associated with ownership of the VIEs, and therefore the Company is the ultimate primary\\nbeneficiary of these VIEs. As such, the Company consolidates the financial statements of these VIEs. Consequently, the financial results of the VIEs\\nwere included in the Group’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with the presentation as stated in Note 2(a).\\nThe following is a summary of the contractual agreements entered into by and among the Company’s relevant subsidiaries, the VIEs, and\\nrespective nominee shareholders of the VIEs.\\nExclusive Technology Consulting and Services Agreements. Under the exclusive technology consulting and services agreements between the\\nCompany’s relevant subsidiaries and the VIEs, the Company’s relevant subsidiaries have the exclusive right to provide the VIEs consulting and services\\nrelated to, among other things, research and development, system operation, advertising, internal training and technical support. The Company’s relevant\\nsubsidiaries have the exclusive ownership of intellectual property rights created as a result of the performance of these agreements. These VIEs shall pay\\nthe Company’s relevant subsidiaries an annual service fee, which are subject to the adjustment by the Company’s relevant subsidiaries at its sole\\ndiscretion. These agreements will remain effective for a 10 year’s term and then be automatically renewed, unless the Company’s relevant subsidiaries\\ngive the VIEs a termination notice 90 days before the term ends. On December 23, 2020, the above agreements were replaced by the exclusive business\\ncooperation agreements, which contain terms substantially similar to the exclusive business cooperation agreements described above, the exclusive\\nbusiness cooperation agreements have an infinite period commencing from December 23, 2020, unless the Company’s relevant subsidiaries give the\\nVIEs a termination notice 30 days before the term ends.\\nF-14']"
